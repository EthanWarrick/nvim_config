# Neovim Starter

Base configuration for Neovim. For those looking to make Neovim their new main editor. Here you'll find a popular combination of plugin to make your experience a little bit better.

A few things have been configured to resemble other modern text editors. You'll find a file explorer with tree style view, list open files in tabs, git integration and a terminal easy to toggle.

Autocompletion and "code intellisense" is provided by the LSP client built into Neovim. The following language servers are configured:

* tsserver
* eslint
* cssls
* html

Most of the code in this configuration is explained in this series:

* [Build your first Neovim configuration in lua](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/build-your-first-lua-config-for-neovim/)
* [Neovim: Plugins to get started](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/neovim-plugins-to-get-started/)
* [Setup nvim-lspconfig + nvim-cmp](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/setup-nvim-lspconfig-plus-nvim-cmp/)

## Requirements

* Neovim v0.8 or greater.
* git.
* A `C` compiler. Can be `gcc`, `tcc` or `zig`.
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), the build tool.
* [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm). Javascript package manager.
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/es/). Javascript runtime. Required by the language servers listed above.
* (optional) [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Improves project wide search speed.
* (optional) [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd). Improves file search speed.
* (optional) A patched font to display icons. I hear [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) has a good collection.

> Here's the config [compatible with v0.7](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/4e7ccba7e69182f3dc1ee2f27be66677118c35b6). 

## Installation

* Backup your existing configuration if you have one.

* If you don't know the path of the Neovim configuration folder use this command.

```sh
nvim --headless -c 'echo stdpath("config") | quit'
```

* Now clone this repository in that location.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter /tmp/nvim-config-path
```

> Do not execute this command as is. Replace `/tmp/nvim-config-path` with the correct path from the previous step.

* Move to the configuration folder where you clone the repository. Change branch to `05-modular`.

```sh
git checkout 05-modular
```

* Next time you start Neovim all plugins will be downloaded automatically. After this process is done `nvim-treesitter` will install language parsers for treesitter. And, `mason.nvim` will download language servers listed in the configuration. Use the command `:Mason` to check the download process of language servers.

## Motions vs Text-Objects
> **_NOTE:_**  This section is based on my current understanding of
vi/vim/neovim and may contradict official documentation.

This topic is somewhat relevant when trying to make keymaps. Motions and
text-objects often correspond, but this does not make them the same.
Essentially, motions *move* the cursor while text-objects define some *area* of
text. Typing `w` in **Normal Mode** performs a motion - it moves the cursor to
the next word. Typing `yw` performs the yank operator on the *text-object* `w`
representing the area of text from the initial cursor position to the next word.
In this way both the `w` motion and text-object correspond to each other - both
essentially mean 'from here to the next word'. They differ because because the
motion just moves the cursor and the text-object is the data structure
specifying an area of text passed to the operator.

Another way to consider this is with modes. Motions are performed in **Normal
Mode** and text-objects are given in **Operator-Pending Mode**. As a reminder,
operators are commands like `y` (yank) and `d` (delete) while **Operator-Pending
Mode** is the mode entered after an operator is performed. **Operator-Pending
Mode** is specifically for supplying text-objects on which the given operator is
performed. Operators are specifically distinguished from other vim commands
because they initiate **Operator-Pending Mode** and perform their function on a
text-object. Alternatively, non-operator vim commands include anything not
operating on a text object. The command `i` (enter insert mode) isn't an
operator because is isn't performed on a group of text. The command `r` isn't an
operator because it only changes a single character.

**Visual Mode** is kind of a special case that seems to except both motions and
text objects. I believe that, actually, **Visual Mode** just has additional,
corresponding keymappings to represent the selection one would expect.
The selections made in **Visual Mode** can be passed to an operator as the
needed text-object.

All of this is to say that three keymappings are needed to implement custom
keymaps emulating the standard vim motion/text-object functionality. 

1. **Normal Mode** keymap: This is to provide the motion functionality - where
you want the cursor to end up.
2. **Operator-Pending Mode** keymap: This is to provide the text selection
passed to an operator performed from normal mode.
3. **Visual Mode** keymap: This is select the desired text within visual mode.

These keymappings likely will need to be setup to perform specific commands or
functions to make the desired movement and grab the desired text. A useful way
to make text selections in **Operator-Pending Mode** is mapping to the `:normal`
command followed by some visual mode selection. This allows for full text
selection with some predefined visual mode sequence.
